Future changes:
* Change register error label to UIAlert
* Configure the register email to be cooler
* Enable login through facebook, gmail, etc...
* Require email confirmation
* Implement I forgot my username/password
* Don't call backendless shared instance multiple times if i dont have to
* add options to go back to the previous view ( add an unwind segue between login and register )
* implement a minimum 6 character password
* Change the custom order fields to accurately match their goals (time -> timefield, destination -> categoryfield)
* when user opens text box in custom order, push the request button/bar up
* correct the color scheme and design on the segment control
* implement an administrator (with authorities) for each circle

Moving forward:
* Display a menu looking thing, items become selectable, selecting an item adds to cart, check out button on the bottom 
* Add a no orders :( screen

Short term goals:
* add a navigation bar item for the karma points
* add functionality to complete request
* give people images **** important to do early ****

Bugs:
* man... default value of circleId is "-1"... figure out what null is in this scenario
* circle.name doesnt get pulled from the db properly, for now we're using displayName but need to use the unique value
* on first login, there's a space above table views


Things I need on the design side:
* Shouldn't the order button be much bigger?
* Gonna need those menus... man the menus is nuts
* A different picture for each of those tabs on the order1 page
* How will the request for laundry be different from shopping and custom (do each of those types have different order pages?)
* Request vs Order

Notes:
* Filter/search bar on top of circle join 
* Checkbox for pricing 
* Menu making
* Billboard/Pending -> Pending/Accepted
* Karma point tap -> transaction history
