Current Goals:
* Functionality to direct transfer
* Functionality to change user settings like password, name, picture
* Adding user images
* Figure out how paging works

Quick Wins/Design changes:
* Change the unselected tab bar icon to be white, not grey
* Fix up the custom order pages (when keyboard appears, push request button up)
* Settings page buttons should have the icon included (and edges should be rounded (or ask isaac))
* Sleeken segmented control on main screen
* Eliminate thin bar on the bottom on main screen
* Guard value of cost
* Add a superclass of direct transfer and custom request to avoid redundancy

Big Change Icebox:
* Add a menu
* Multiple circles
* Push notifications
* Adding people through invites and search
* Open transaction history on Karma point button

Small Change Icebox:
* Add a no orders :( screen
* Error label migration to UIAlert
* Email confirmation on registration
* Upgrade registration email
* Implement I forgot my username/password
* implement a minimum 6 character password
* implement an administrator (with authorities) for each circle

Bugs/Hacks:
* Circle.displayName is being used instead of Circle.name
* "-1" is used as the null value rather than just null

Things I need done by the end of the week:
* Get Karma's logo up and running
* Add a no orders picture
* Test app on multiple devices and add constraints
* Finish up direct transfer
* Reroute orders to just custom orders
* Add validation on custom orders

Process by which people join a circle:
a circle is made
the person trying to join searches for the created circle by the display name
once they find, the person is added to a list within the group that is accessible to everyone else there
this list is the wait list and anyone in the group can accept the person
meanwhile, the person who tried to join will have a circle id of -2 so their screen when they log in will be a
"waiting for the circle to accept or join a different circle"
once someone accepts the person,
the person is assigned a circle id and all is well
