Future changes:
* Change register error label to UIAlert
* Configure the register email to be cooler
* Require email confirmation
* Implement I forgot my username/password
* Don't call backendless shared instance multiple times if i dont have to
* Extrapolate user into a class on my end to generalize server calls -> apparently can't do this due to serialization issues
* add options to go back to the previous view
* implement a minimum 6 character password

Moving forward:
* Make the list view for all the circles, make it so that clicking on the list adds you to the circle

Bugs:
* man... default value of circleId is "-1"... figure out what null is in this scenario
* circle.name doesnt get pulled from the db properly, for now we're using displayName but need to use hte unique value
