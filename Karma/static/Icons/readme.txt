These files are formatted in png, so the blank spaces behind the icons shouldn't
appear as white space or anything; however, the last time I sent you something with
some space formatted in png, it still appeared as white space. If these files still show
white space, I honestly am not sure how to get these icons to you without white space. 
There may be some settings that you can fiddle with in your program to allow for transparency?
